# XLAPI

XLAPI is a Java library that provides a simple and efficient way to read and write xlsx files. It uses annotations to map Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs) to spreadsheet cells, allowing you to serialize and deserialize POJOs in a declarative manner. You can also perform different types of serializations to the same POJO at the same time, by using different annotation sets. XLAPI is still in development and welcomes contributions from the community.
